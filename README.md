# Learn C++ with OpenClassromm

## Introduction

Hi everyone! I need to learn C++, and, in order to achieve it properly, I follow this excellent tutorial: "https://openclassrooms.com/courses/programmez-avec-le-langage-c"
I'm using this Github repository to track my work. 

## Run the program

* Download the project
* Go to the repository using cd /my/path/to/Cpp_OpenClassroom
* Use the command `make`, it will create an executable called Cpp_OpenClassroom
* Run the programm using the command `./Cpp_OpenClassroom`
